&lt;p&gt;Longhorn Bank is in need of several changes to their business applications. They need these applications to be consolidated. They have many different systems that provide everything from personal bank accounts to merchant services. All these applications have different authentication logins and a different user interface. We will need to create a single sign on so that any application may be accessed through the same login as well as creating a uniform interface for all applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like many other businesses these days, Longhorn Bank would like all of the applications to also operate on mobile. We will be in charge of purchasing the infrastructure so that this migration can take place. We will also be creating a new web application so that the all the applications are integrated to provide a dashboard on employee performance. Both the mobile migration and new application are a means to help track and reduce TAT. Over the course of 7 months we will need to complete all of the tasks above. The infrastructure and implementations of the total project has a budget of $120,000.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lorem Ipsum&lt;/strong&gt; is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;standard dummy text&lt;/em&gt; ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;
